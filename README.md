## 🚀 Overview

A **web-based chatbot** designed to automate customer support by processing user queries, detecting sentiment, and generating empathetic, context-aware replies using GPT-2. Deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** for fast and easy access.

---

## 🎯 Features

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifies customer messages into *positive*, *negative*, or *neutral* sentiments using VADER and TextBlob.  
- **Empathetic Response Generation:** Leverages GPT-2 to create tailored, human-like replies with fallback default messages for edge cases.  
- **Issue Trend Visualization:** Visualizes common customer issues via Seaborn bar charts for quick insights.  
- **Live Demo:** Accessible through Streamlit Cloud deployment for instant testing.

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Loading:** Imports a public dataset for training — [Twitter Corpus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zfz/twitter_corpus/master/full-corpus.csv).  
2. **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans text by removing URLs, special characters, and lowercasing.  
3. **Model Training:** Uses TF-IDF vectorization with logistic regression to classify customer issues.  
4. **Sentiment Detection:** Applies VADER sentiment analysis, enhanced with custom rules for negative phrases.  
5. **Response Generation:** GPT-2 generates empathetic replies with a 10-second timeout; defaults used if generation fails.  
6. **Visualization:** Displays issue distribution for actionable insights.
